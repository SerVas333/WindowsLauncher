## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**1. WSA Not Found**
```
WARNING: Windows Subsystem for Android not found!
```
**Solution**: Install WSA from Microsoft Store or check WSA installation

**2. Log Directory Not Accessible**
```
Error: Log directory not found: /mnt/c/WindowsLauncher/Logs
```
**Solution**: Run WindowsLauncher first to create log directory, or create manually

**3. PowerShell Execution Policy**
```
Execution of scripts is disabled on this system
```
**Solution**: 
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

**4. No WSA Events in Logs**
**Check**:
- WSA applications are launched through WindowsLauncher
- Logging levels are set to Trace for WSA components
- Application is running in correct environment (Development/Production)

**5. Cross-Platform Path Issues**
**Windows Paths**: `C:\WindowsLauncher\Logs\`
**WSL Paths**: `/mnt/c/WindowsLauncher/Logs/`
**Ensure**: Consistent use of absolute paths in configurations

### Debug Checklist

**Before Debugging:**
- [ ] WSA is installed and can run Android applications
- [ ] WindowsLauncher compiles without errors
- [ ] Scripts are executable (`chmod +x Scripts/*.sh`)
- [ ] Log directory exists and is accessible

**During Debugging:**
- [ ] Monitor real-time logs for WSA operations
- [ ] Check WSA window detection algorithms
- [ ] Verify AppSwitcher integration
- [ ] Monitor performance metrics

**After Debugging:**
- [ ] Analyze WSA events and performance
- [ ] Document any issues or improvements
- [ ] Generate reports for team review

## üìà Performance Optimization

### Log File Management
- **Rolling Intervals**: Daily (production) vs Hourly (development)
- **File Sizes**: 50MB (production) vs 100MB+ (development)
- **Retention**: 7 days (production) vs 24 hours (development)
- **Formats**: Structured JSON for WSA events, plain text for application logs

### Monitoring Efficiency
- **Filtering**: WSA-specific filtering reduces noise by ~80%
- **Caching**: WSL file system caching improves monitoring performance
- **Buffering**: Real-time monitoring uses efficient buffering strategies

### Analysis Performance
- **Batch Processing**: Analyze logs in date-specific batches
- **Indexing**: Use grep and awk for efficient pattern matching
- **Report Generation**: JSON format for automated processing, summary for human review

## üîó Integration with Development Tools

### Visual Studio Integration
The debugging infrastructure integrates seamlessly with Visual Studio development:

1. **Build Events**: Can be integrated with VS build events
2. **Output Window**: Logs appear in VS Output window during debug
3. **Breakpoints**: Standard C# debugging works alongside log monitoring
4. **IntelliSense**: No impact on IDE performance or functionality

### Git Workflow Integration
- Scripts and configurations are version controlled
- Log files are excluded via `.gitignore`
- Cross-platform development supports multiple developers
- Configuration changes are tracked and reviewable

## üìù Best Practices

### Development Practices
1. **Always use Development mode** for WSA feature development
2. **Monitor logs in real-time** during testing sessions
3. **Generate analysis reports** after significant testing
4. **Document WSA-specific issues** in commit messages

### Performance Practices
1. **Clear logs regularly** to prevent disk space issues
2. **Use filtering** to focus on relevant WSA events
3. **Monitor cache efficiency** to optimize WSA performance
4. **Analyze performance trends** over development cycles

### Security Practices
1. **Log files may contain sensitive information** - handle appropriately
2. **WSA integration logs** may include package names and window titles
3. **Cross-platform access** should be limited to development machines
4. **Production logs** should be collected securely for analysis
