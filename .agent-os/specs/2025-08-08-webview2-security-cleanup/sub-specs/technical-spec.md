# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-08-webview2-security-cleanup/spec.md

## Technical Requirements

### WebView2 Security Configuration System

- **WebView2SecurityConfiguration**: Enum-based strategy selection (Immediate, OnUserSwitch, OnAppExit)  
- **Configuration Integration**: appsettings.json configuration section with runtime override capability
- **Default Strategy**: OnUserSwitch for optimal balance of security and performance

### IWebView2SecurityService Interface Design

- **ClearUserCookiesAsync(userId)**: Clear all cookies and session storage for specific user
- **ClearUserCacheAsync(userId)**: Remove browser cache, temporary files, and offline storage for user
- **ClearUserBrowsingDataAsync(userId)**: Delete navigation history and form data for specific user  
- **SecurelyDeleteUserDataFolderAsync(userId)**: Complete filesystem removal of user's WebView2 folder
- **ClearAllUsersDataAsync()**: Batch operation for complete cleanup on application exit

### User-Scoped WebView2 Data Management

- **UserDataFolder Path Structure**: `%LocalAppData%\WindowsLauncher\WebView2\{UserId}\{InstanceId}`
- **User Isolation**: Each authenticated user gets separate WebView2 data directory tree
- **Instance Isolation**: Each WebView2 window instance has unique subfolder under user directory
- **Cleanup Scope**: Remove entire user directory tree during logout, preserve other users' data

### WebView2ApplicationWindow Integration

- **Instant Window Closing**: Replace current cleanup in Window_Closing with immediate Dispose() only
- **Optional Quick Cleanup**: Configurable fast cookie clearing for high-security environments (10-20ms)
- **User Context Integration**: Inject current user ID into WebView2 UserDataFolder path construction
- **Event-Based Cleanup Trigger**: Subscribe to AuthenticationService logout events for data clearing

### AuthenticationService Integration Points

- **Logout Event Hook**: `AuthenticationService.LogoutAsync()` triggers user-specific data clearing
- **User Switch Event**: `AuthenticationService.SwitchUserAsync()` clears previous user's WebView2 data
- **Background Processing**: Data clearing operations run asynchronously after user logout completes
- **Error Handling**: Failed cleanup operations logged as warnings but don't block logout process

### Application Exit Handler Implementation

- **App.xaml.cs Integration**: Application_Exit event handler for final cleanup operations
- **Global Cleanup**: Remove entire WebView2 root directory on application termination
- **Graceful Degradation**: Manual filesystem operations if WebView2 API clearing fails
- **Startup Cleanup**: Optional cleanup of orphaned WebView2 data from previous app crashes

### Performance Optimization Requirements

- **Window Close Time**: Target under 10ms for WebView2 window disposal
- **User Logout Time**: Complete data clearing within 200ms of logout initiation  
- **Batch Operations**: Single directory tree removal instead of individual file operations
- **Background Threading**: All I/O operations on background threads to prevent UI blocking
- **Memory Management**: Proper disposal patterns to prevent memory leaks during cleanup

### Security and Compliance Features

- **Complete Data Removal**: Verify no personal data survives user logout or app exit
- **Audit Logging**: Detailed logs of all clearing operations with success/failure status
- **Compliance Reporting**: Generate cleanup verification logs for security audit purposes
- **Retry Mechanisms**: Automatic retry for failed clearing operations with exponential backoff
- **Fallback Cleanup**: Manual file deletion if WebView2 API operations fail

### Error Handling and Resilience

- **Exception Isolation**: Clearing failures don't prevent application or window closure
- **Partial Cleanup Detection**: Identify and handle incomplete data removal scenarios
- **Logging Strategy**: Error-level logging for security-critical failures, warnings for minor issues
- **Recovery Procedures**: Cleanup retry logic and manual intervention procedures for persistent failures

## External Dependencies

This specification uses only existing dependencies and requires no new external libraries:

- **Microsoft.Web.WebView2**: Already used for WebView2 functionality
- **Microsoft.Extensions.Logging**: Already used for logging throughout application  
- **Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration**: Already used for appsettings.json configuration
- **System.IO**: Built-in .NET libraries for filesystem operations
