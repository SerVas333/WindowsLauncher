# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: WebView2 Security Data Cleanup
> Created: 2025-08-08
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement comprehensive data clearing mechanisms for WebView2ApplicationWindow using a hybrid performance-optimized strategy to ensure cookies, cache, browsing history, and personal data are securely removed when users switch accounts or exit the application, addressing security requirements for handling personal data in corporate environments.

## User Stories

### System Administrator Security Story

As a system administrator, I want all WebView2 windows to automatically clear personal data using an optimized strategy, so that no sensitive information persists on workstations between users or sessions without impacting application performance.

When a user switches accounts or exits the application, the system should:
1. Clear all cookies and session data for the logged-out user
2. Remove cached files and temporary data from user-specific folders
3. Delete browsing history and navigation data
4. Clear form data and autofill information
5. Securely delete user-specific UserDataFolder directories
6. Log all clearing operations for security audit compliance

### Application Performance Story

As an end user, I want WebView2 windows to close instantly without delays, so that my workflow is not interrupted by security cleanup operations.

WebView2 windows should:
- Close immediately with minimal delay (under 10ms)
- Perform security cleanup in the background during user transitions
- Provide visual feedback when security operations are in progress

### Compliance Officer Story

As a compliance officer, I want verification that WebView2 applications don't retain personal data after user logout, so that we meet GDPR and corporate data protection requirements.

The system should:
- Provide detailed logs of all data clearing operations
- Verify successful cleanup with filesystem validation
- Generate compliance reports for audit purposes

## Spec Scope

1. **Hybrid Clearing Strategy** - Implement configurable data clearing with three strategies: immediate, on user switch, and on application exit
2. **IWebView2SecurityService** - Create centralized service for managing all WebView2 data clearing operations
3. **User-Specific Data Management** - Implement user-scoped WebView2 data folders with complete cleanup per user
4. **AuthenticationService Integration** - Hook into user logout/switch events for automatic data clearing
5. **Application Exit Handler** - Ensure complete data cleanup when application terminates

## Out of Scope

- Cross-user data sharing modifications
- Global WebView2 runtime settings changes
- User preference retention (intentionally cleared for security)
- Performance optimization beyond clearing strategy selection

## Expected Deliverable

1. WebView2ApplicationWindow closes instantly (under 10ms) without blocking security operations
2. Complete user data clearing integrated with AuthenticationService logout/switch events
3. IWebView2SecurityService with comprehensive data clearing methods and error handling
4. Configurable security policies through WebView2SecurityConfiguration
5. Full unit and integration test coverage for all clearing operations
6. Security audit logging for compliance verification
